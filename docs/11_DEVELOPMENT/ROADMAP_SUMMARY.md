# Roadmap Summary

ETLantic **0.19.0** is stable for documented single-tenant reference
deployments (contract and configuration freeze). Milestones describe
capability order, not release-date commitments.

## Shipped: 0.15 through 0.19

ETLantic **0.15.0** closed Safe SQL Lowering and the LocalScheduler companion.

ETLantic **0.16.0** shipped authoring vocabulary cleanup and optional
`etlantic-prefect` `ExecutionScheduler`.

ETLantic **0.17.0** shipped portable coverage expansion (platform + Wave 1/2
on Polars + PySpark). Pandas and SQL remain kernel + `portable-relational/1`.

ETLantic **0.18.0** shipped Gate A versioned tabular interchange
(`etlantic.interchange/1`) for Polars↔Pandas. See
[What's New in 0.18](../01_GETTING_STARTED/WHATS_NEW_0_18.md).

ETLantic **0.19.0** shipped the **Contract and Configuration Freeze**:
deep plan immutability, fingerprint trust-boundary verify, `security_mode`,
strict profile resolution, wire schema gates, surface inventory, and
pre-1.0 deprecation schedule. See
[What's New in 0.19](../01_GETTING_STARTED/WHATS_NEW_0_19.md).

## 0.18 Gate A (still current)

Gate A = **0.18.0** (interchange baseline). DataFusion remains a
**non-blocking** Gate B experiment (`etlantic-datafusion` Experimental in
0.19; not graduated).

## Toward 1.0

The 1.0 goal is a stable foundation with frozen contracts (0.19), completed
trust/isolation gates (0.20+), conformance across reference engines, and
complete migration guides.

> **Production use is supported only within the documented reference
> envelope.** See the [Evaluator Brief](../01_GETTING_STARTED/EVALUATOR.md).
