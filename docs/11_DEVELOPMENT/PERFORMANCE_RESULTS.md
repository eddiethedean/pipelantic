# Performance Baselines

ETLantic does not yet publish production-grade performance claims. This page
defines the evidence required before such claims are made.

## Current evidence

The repository includes `benchmarks/dataframe_scale.py`, a lightweight timing
and correctness harness for Polars and Pandas. Its results are environment
dependent and are not a substitute for validation/planning scale benchmarks.

```bash
uv sync --group dataframes
uv run python benchmarks/dataframe_scale.py polars
uv run python benchmarks/dataframe_scale.py pandas
```

## Reproducible result format

Every published result must include commit, Python and dependency versions,
CPU, memory, operating system, dataset shape, warm-up count, sample count,
median, p95, and raw result artifact. Report ETLantic overhead separately from
backend execution and I/O.

## Published smoke baseline

The following numbers are a reproducibility smoke test, not a throughput claim.
They are one harness invocation per engine over 50,000 rows; no distribution or
p95 is available yet.

| Commit | Environment | ETLantic | Backend | Rows | Elapsed | Status |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---|
| `838feba` | macOS 26.5.2, arm64, Python 3.11.14 | 0.10.0 | Polars 1.42.1 | 50,000 | 0.3332 s | succeeded |
| `838feba` | macOS 26.5.2, arm64, Python 3.11.14 | 0.10.0 | Pandas 2.3.3 | 50,000 | 0.3340 s | succeeded |

These results establish that the committed harness completes for both reference
dataframe plugins on the recorded environment. They do not establish that the
engines have equivalent performance, and they must not be extrapolated to
production data shapes.

## Adoption guidance

Until representative baselines are published, evaluators must benchmark their
own graph sizes, plugin discovery, plan generation, and run-report overhead.
Do not infer backend throughput from ETLantic's framework timings.
