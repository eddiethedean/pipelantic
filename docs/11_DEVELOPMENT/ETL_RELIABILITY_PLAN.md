# ETL Reliability and Recovery Plan

## Purpose

An ETL pipeline can be structurally valid and still produce an untrustworthy
result. Inputs may be stale or incomplete, retries may repeat side effects,
backfills may overwrite the wrong partitions, two backend implementations may
disagree, and an apparently successful load may not reconcile with its source.

Pipelantic should model and coordinate these reliability concerns without
becoming a scheduler, execution engine, storage system, or statistical
monitoring platform.

The core should own:

- portable intent;
- static analysis;
- deterministic planning;
- capability negotiation;
- normalized observations and evidence;
- policy decisions;
- impact and repair planning;
- reports and diagnostics.

Plugins and providers should perform backend-specific inspection, execution,
measurement, persistence, and notification.

## Scope

This plan covers ten related capability families:

1. freshness and partition completeness;
2. incremental invalidation and repair planning;
3. idempotency and retry safety;
4. explicit write and materialization semantics;
5. reconciliation;
6. backfill planning;
7. cross-backend implementation parity;
8. plan and environment drift;
9. data-quality trends;
10. statistical data drift.

These are operational models, policies, observations, and evidence. They are
not additional top-level contract standards.

## Shared Reliability Model

Each capability should follow a consistent lifecycle:

```text
Declared expectation or intent
              │
              ▼
Observation or proposed operation
              │
              ▼
Normalized evidence
              │
              ▼
Policy evaluation
              │
              ▼
Decision and affected graph
              │
              ▼
Execution, remediation, or review
              │
              ▼
Durable report and history
```

Shared models should include:

- stable subject identity;
- profile, environment, workspace, and security domain;
- observation time and provenance;
- evidence and confidence;
- policy revision and decision;
- affected nodes, fields, partitions, and artifacts;
- acknowledgement, approval, and remediation references;
- deterministic fingerprints where possible.

## Freshness and Partition Completeness

### Problem

A source may exist and match its schema while still being too old, missing
expected partitions, or only partially published.

### Model

Freshness expectations should describe:

- maximum acceptable age;
- event-time, ingestion-time, publication-time, or source-revision basis;
- expected schedule or availability window;
- grace period and timezone;
- authoritative timestamp or provider capability;
- behavior when no new data is expected.

Partition-completeness expectations should describe:

- partition key and logical partition domain;
- expected ranges or enumerated partitions;
- allowed lateness;
- minimum counts or control manifests;
- partial-publication indicators;
- late, missing, duplicate, and unexpected partition handling.

### Planning and runtime

Pipelantic should support:

- preflight freshness checks;
- partition-manifest inspection;
- waiting, warning, blocking, or skipping according to policy;
- a distinct `NO_NEW_DATA` outcome rather than treating it as failure;
- downstream impact for stale or incomplete inputs;
- freshness and completeness evidence in `PipelineRunReport`.

Live checks require explicit provider authority and never occur during static
planning.

## Incremental Invalidation and Repair Planning

### Problem

When an input partition, source snapshot, contract, implementation, or output
changes, teams need the smallest safe rerun rather than a blind full rebuild.

### Model

The planner should combine:

- changed subjects and partitions;
- dataset and column lineage;
- state cursors, watermarks, and checkpoints;
- artifact identities and validity;
- transformation determinism and side effects;
- materialization and publication boundaries;
- contract and schema impact;
- downstream reuse rules.

### Outputs

A `RepairPlan` should explain:

- invalidated and reusable artifacts;
- minimum upstream and downstream closure;
- partitions or ranges to recompute;
- state that must remain unchanged;
- unsafe side effects;
- required approvals;
- expected writes and reconciliation checks;
- why each node was included or excluded.

Repair execution must consume an ordinary `RunRequest` and `PipelinePlan`
extension rather than introduce a separate runtime.

## Idempotency and Retry Safety

### Problem

Retries, reruns, backfills, and resumed runs can duplicate writes, events, API
calls, and other side effects.

### Model

Transformations, sinks, callbacks, and providers should declare:

- pure or side-effecting behavior;
- deterministic or nondeterministic behavior;
- idempotency scope and key;
- retry safety;
- transaction boundary;
- deduplication support;
- compensation or rollback capability;
- externally visible effect;
- maximum safe attempts.

Idempotency is conditional. A merge may be idempotent only for a stable key,
source snapshot, predicate, and write policy.

### Validation

The planner should:

- reject retries for undeclared or unsafe side effects;
- ensure idempotency keys include the correct run, input, partition, or effect
  identity;
- prevent retry policy from crossing transaction or publication boundaries;
- distinguish retry, replay, resume, and intentional duplicate processing;
- record the safety proof and residual risk in the plan.

## Explicit Write and Materialization Semantics

### Problem

Generic `write` and `save` operations hide destructive behavior, portability
limitations, and materialization costs.

### Write intent

Portable write intents should initially include:

- append;
- insert-only;
- replace;
- replace selected partitions;
- merge or upsert;
- create-table-as;
- insert-select;
- snapshot publication;
- delete propagation;
- slowly changing dimension strategies;
- validate-only and no-write modes.

Each intent should declare keys, matching behavior, schema-evolution policy,
transaction needs, conflict behavior, and idempotency assumptions.

### Materialization intent

Materialization should describe:

- in-memory, lazy, cached, temporary, durable, or external-reference form;
- persistence lifetime and cleanup;
- reuse and invalidation rules;
- serialization and interchange format;
- partitioning and ordering;
- security classification and encryption;
- whether materialization is required for validation, retry, branching,
  orchestration, or backend transition.

Plugins must either preserve requested semantics, select an explicitly approved
fallback, or fail compilation before execution.

## Reconciliation

### Problem

A successful write does not prove that source and destination agree.

### Model

Reconciliation checks should support:

- row and distinct-key counts;
- accepted, rejected, inserted, updated, and deleted counts;
- control totals and aggregates;
- checksums or fingerprints;
- partition coverage;
- source-to-sink lag;
- key-set comparison;
- referential checks;
- bounded tolerance and rounding rules.

Checks may compare sources, intermediate artifacts, sinks, manifests, or
independent control systems.

### Evidence

Providers calculate backend-specific evidence. Pipelantic normalizes:

- compared subjects and snapshots;
- metric definitions;
- expected and observed values;
- tolerances;
- completeness and confidence;
- policy decision;
- remediation and affected downstream nodes.

Reconciliation failures should be distinguishable from transformation,
validation, and publication failures.

## Backfill Planning

### Problem

Backfills are often improvised scripts with unclear scope, cost, write
behavior, and side effects.

### Model

A `BackfillRequest` should describe:

- temporal, partition, key, or snapshot range;
- inclusive and exclusive bounds;
- source and contract revisions;
- profile and implementation selection;
- write and existing-output behavior;
- concurrency and rate limits;
- notification and callback policy;
- checkpoint isolation;
- reconciliation requirements;
- approval and cost budgets.

### Preview

Before execution, a backfill plan should show:

- dependency closure;
- partitions, batches, and estimated task count;
- selected backends and implementations;
- materialization and publication boundaries;
- expected scans, writes, and destructive operations;
- side effects suppressed or permitted;
- estimated resources, duration, and cost with confidence;
- idempotency and retry assessment;
- state transitions and rollback constraints.

Backfill execution uses ordinary plans, reports, policies, and provider
interfaces.

## Cross-Backend Implementation Parity

### Problem

Pandas, Polars, SQL, and PySpark implementations of one transformation may
differ in null behavior, precision, ordering, timezone handling, or invalid
record treatment.

### Conformance model

Transformation authors should define shared fixtures, properties, or generated
cases. The parity harness should compare:

- output contracts and normalized schemas;
- values within declared tolerance;
- null and missing-value behavior;
- numeric precision and rounding;
- date, timestamp, and timezone behavior;
- ordering guarantees;
- duplicate and key behavior;
- valid and invalid outputs;
- side effects and write intent;
- deterministic replay;
- diagnostics and lineage evidence.

Results should classify implementations as conforming, conditionally
conforming, nonconforming, or not comparable.

Backend-specific differences may be documented capabilities, but cannot be
silently treated as equivalent semantics.

## Plan and Environment Drift

### Problem

The logical pipeline may remain unchanged while production behavior changes
because profiles, plugins, implementations, policies, statistics, bindings, or
optimizer decisions changed.

### Tracked identity

Pipelantic should fingerprint:

- logical pipeline and contract revisions;
- resolved profile;
- environment and capability inventory;
- plugin, provider, and implementation versions;
- selected implementations;
- policy bundle;
- optimization inputs and decisions;
- `PipelinePlan`;
- compiled backend artifacts.

### Comparison

Plan and environment drift should identify:

- implementation selection changes;
- new materialization or backend boundaries;
- write, retry, validation, or security-policy changes;
- resource and cost changes;
- plugin or provider upgrades;
- capability gain or loss;
- binding and secret-reference changes without exposing values;
- optimizer decisions that materially change execution.

Policies may record, warn, require approval, or block deployment and execution.

## Data-Quality Trends

### Problem

One run may pass while quality gradually deteriorates.

### Metrics

Pipelantic should normalize time-series evidence such as:

- null, invalid, duplicate, and rejection rates;
- record and partition counts;
- distinct-key counts and cardinality;
- referential-integrity results;
- validation latency and failure rates;
- reconciliation deltas;
- freshness and completeness;
- schema and statistical drift frequency.

Providers store and query metric history. Pipelantic defines metric identity,
dimensions, policy inputs, report summaries, and trend diagnostics.

Initial trend analysis should use explainable rules such as thresholds, moving
windows, percentage changes, and consecutive violations. Advanced anomaly
detection remains provider-driven.

## Statistical Data Drift

### Problem

Data meaning may change without a schema change, such as a categorical code
becoming a full name or a numeric distribution shifting significantly.

### Observations

Statistical observations may include:

- null and missing rates;
- cardinality and new categorical values;
- min, max, quantiles, mean, and variance;
- length and pattern summaries;
- frequency sketches and histograms;
- referential and uniqueness rates;
- bounded distribution-distance measures.

### Privacy and safety

Statistical profiling is opt-in and must declare:

- selected fields and metrics;
- sampling and confidence;
- row, byte, cardinality, and time budgets;
- classification and privacy policy;
- retention and sharing scope;
- prohibited sensitive fields;
- redaction or aggregation requirements.

Raw values, unrestricted category sets, and sensitive exemplars must not enter
plans, diagnostics, reports, prompts, or general-purpose metric stores.

Statistical drift is evidence, not proof of a defect. Policies should generally
warn or require review before blocking unless an organization explicitly
defines a mandatory gate.

## CLI and API

Planned commands include:

```text
pipelantic freshness check
pipelantic partitions check
pipelantic impact data
pipelantic repair explain
pipelantic repair plan
pipelantic backfill plan
pipelantic reconcile
pipelantic implementations compare
pipelantic plan diff
pipelantic environment diff
pipelantic quality trends
pipelantic data-drift inspect
```

The Python API, CLI, FastAPI integration, IDE, notebooks, and AI tooling should
share the same request, result, policy, and evidence models.

## Reporting and Developer Experience

`PipelineRunReport` should include normalized evidence for:

- freshness and completeness;
- invalidation and reuse;
- retry and idempotency decisions;
- writes and materializations;
- reconciliation;
- backfill scope and progress;
- implementation identity and parity status;
- plan and environment drift;
- quality trends;
- statistical drift.

IDE and notebook tooling should offer:

- freshness and incomplete-partition indicators;
- repair and backfill previews;
- unsafe-retry and destructive-write diagnostics;
- reconciliation results;
- implementation comparison;
- plan and environment diffs;
- bounded quality and drift charts;
- navigation to affected models, policies, fields, and sinks.

AI tools may explain evidence and propose repairs, tests, adapters, or policy
changes, but cannot approve destructive writes, backfills, retries, baseline
changes, or production execution.

## Security

These capabilities can require powerful access and reveal sensitive metadata.

Required controls include:

- read-only inspection credentials where possible;
- separate inspect, plan, approve, execute, and acknowledge authorities;
- bounded scans, samples, profiles, and history queries;
- explicit destructive-write and backfill approval;
- tenant and security-domain isolation;
- no secret values in fingerprints, comparisons, or reports;
- privacy review for statistical metrics;
- integrity-protected evidence used for deployment or recovery decisions;
- audit events for repair, backfill, retry override, baseline, and policy
  decisions;
- fail-closed behavior when safety or write semantics are unknown.

## Testing

Conformance testing should cover:

- timezone and schedule boundaries for freshness;
- missing, late, duplicate, and partial partitions;
- invalidation closure and artifact reuse;
- retry matrices across pure, idempotent, transactional, compensatable, and
  unsafe operations;
- write-intent behavior across SQL, Spark, dataframe, and storage plugins;
- reconciliation tolerance and snapshot identity;
- backfill partitioning, state isolation, cancellation, and resume;
- cross-backend null, precision, ordering, timezone, and invalid-data behavior;
- plan and environment fingerprint stability;
- quality-trend windows and notification deduplication;
- statistical-drift privacy budgets and bounded execution.

## Success Criteria

Pipelantic succeeds when a developer can determine:

- Is the input fresh and complete?
- What changed and what must be rebuilt?
- Is retry or replay safe?
- What exactly will be written or materialized?
- Did source and destination reconcile?
- What will a backfill touch and cost?
- Do all implementations preserve the same semantics?
- Why did the physical plan or environment change?
- Is data quality degrading over time?
- Did the data distribution change within approved privacy limits?

The core principle is:

> Pipelantic makes reliability intent explicit, turns runtime behavior into
> comparable evidence, and plans safe recovery without owning the execution
> engines that perform the work.
