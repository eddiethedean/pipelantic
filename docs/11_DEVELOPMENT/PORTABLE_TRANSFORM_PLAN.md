# Portable Transformation Implementation Plan

Status: Internal project plan  
DTCS plan protocol: `dtcs.transform-plan/1`  
ETLantic authoring profile: `etlantic.transform/1`  
Compiler protocol: `etlantic.transform-compiler/1`  
Current release boundary: not available in 0.10

## Outcome

Authors define relational transformation logic once through a PySpark-inspired
DataFrame and Column API. ETLantic validates a closed portable IR, then Polars,
Pandas, SQL, and PySpark plugins compile it without changing its meaning.

## Success criteria

- A portable definition is deterministic, serializable, inspectable, and
  secret-free.
- The same definition executes with contract-equivalent results on at least
  Polars and PySpark before the protocol is declared stable.
- Unsupported operations fail during planning with an expression path.
- Polars and Spark preserve lazy/native expression execution.
- SQL lowering remains parameterized and contains no trusted raw SQL.
- Existing native `@implementation()` behavior remains compatible.
- Plugin conformance tests prove every advertised operation.

## Workstreams

| Workstream | Deliverable |
|---|---|
| Authoring | `@Transformation.portable`, symbolic DataFrame/Column API |
| DTCS kernel | canonical nodes, type system, semantics, serialization, fingerprint |
| Analysis | definition, name, type, contract, and bounded-structure validation |
| Planning | capability extraction, compiler selection, explain output |
| Runtime | compiled-transform execution and normalized outputs |
| Plugins | Polars, PySpark, Pandas, then SQL compilers |
| Interchange | DTCS extension and plan-schema representation |
| Assurance | security limits, golden files, conformance and differential tests |
| DX | diagnostics, symbols, source paths, docs, IDE schemas |

## Package layout

Proposed ETLantic facade modules:

```text
src/etlantic/transform/
├── __init__.py
├── dataframe.py
├── column.py
├── functions.py
├── window.py
├── dtcs_builder.py
├── validate.py
├── capabilities.py
├── protocol.py
└── discovery.py
```

Canonical nodes, portable types, semantics, serialization, and base validation
belong to public `dtcs` package modules. ETLantic MUST NOT duplicate those
models. The ETLantic core MUST NOT import backend libraries. Existing
`etlantic.sql` types may receive a lowering from the DTCS plan, but SQL types do
not become the portable model.

See [DTCS and Portable Transformation Evolution](DTCS_PORTABLE_EVOLUTION.md)
for the coordinated specification/package release workflow.

## 0.11 preparation: decisions and fixtures

Deliver:

- accept ADR-013 and the IR specification
- freeze kernel operation names and portable type vocabulary
- define canonical JSON examples before Python classes
- create semantic truth tables and edge-case fixtures
- define diagnostic code allocation and source-path format
- benchmark acceptable definition and validation overhead

Exit gate: maintainers can review example IR and expected results without any
backend implementation.

## 0.11: symbolic authoring kernel

Deliver:

- `FrameExpr`, `ColumnExpr`, and `GroupedData`
- `@Transformation.portable`
- symbolic input and parameter binding
- project, filter, with-column, drop, rename, alias, distinct, limit, sort
- column references, literals, alias, comparison, boolean, arithmetic, strict
  cast, null predicates, conditional, coalesce, concat, and basic strings
- prohibited action and boolean-conversion errors
- deterministic serialization and fingerprints
- definition validation and output binding

Tests:

- unit tests for every node and operator
- inheritance and multiple-output cases
- unknown argument, missing output, ambiguous column, and type errors
- recursion, depth, node-count, literal-size, and hostile-object limits
- golden canonical JSON and fingerprint stability

Exit gate: definitions generate validated IR, but do not execute.

## 0.12: planning integration

Deliver:

- `TransformCapabilities` and requirement extraction
- compiler descriptors and discovery
- implementation policy: `require`, `prefer`, `native`
- `ImplementationDescriptor` extension for `portable_compiled`
- plan schema update with IR fingerprint, requirements, compiler identity, and
  optional embedded IR or stable artifact reference
- `plan explain` rendering
- diagnostics for unsupported operations and semantic modes
- cache and artifact identity inclusion of IR and compiler fingerprints

Decisions required:

- Embed full IR in `PipelinePlan` versus reference a content-addressed IR
  artifact. Recommendation: embed bounded canonical IR for portability, with a
  future external reference for oversized definitions.
- Whether portable compilation outranks native implementations by default.
  Recommendation: `prefer`, with an explicit profile policy and no silent
  fallback.

Exit gate: planning chooses a compiler deterministically and fails closed when
requirements are unsupported.

## 0.12: Polars vertical slice

Deliver:

- Polars compiler for the PT-1 kernel
- native `pl.Expr` lowering
- eager and lazy input support
- lazy preservation and declared collection boundaries
- existing input/output validation integration
- multiple valid, invalid, and side outputs
- explain metadata and dataframe metrics

Exit gate: a complete example runs without a Polars-specific transformation
callable and retains `LazyFrame` through compatible regions.

## 0.13: PySpark compiler

Deliver:

- native Spark Column/DataFrame lowering for the kernel
- Catalyst-visible expression verification
- Spark session and region integration
- explicit prohibition of UDF fallback
- type, timezone, null, and ownership conformance

Exit gate: Polars and PySpark pass the same semantic fixture corpus.

## 0.13: relational expansion

Deliver:

- join, union-by-name, group-by, aggregation, deduplication, and full ordering
- relation-scoped column resolution
- collision diagnostics
- aggregate typing and empty-input behavior
- Polars and PySpark implementations first

Exit gate: multi-input and aggregate examples pass differential tests.

## 0.14: Pandas compiler and conformance SDK

Deliver:

- eager lowering for all advertised kernel and relational capabilities
- index-neutral semantics
- ownership/copy declarations
- nullable dtype and Arrow-assisted behavior where available
- honest rejection where Pandas cannot preserve semantics

Exit gate: Pandas passes every fixture associated with its advertised
capabilities and does not claim unsupported lazy behavior.

## 0.15: SQL lowering

Deliver:

- portable IR to ETLantic SQL IR lowering
- safe identifier and bound-literal handling
- CTE/region fusion while retaining logical identities
- dialect capability mapping
- no trusted fragments in portable definitions
- cross-engine database integration fixtures

Exit gate: supported portable definitions compile to safe SQL and match the
reference result corpus.

## 0.15+: windows and complex types

Deliver windows, arrays, maps, structs, and advanced functions one semantic
family at a time. Each addition requires specification text, two compilers,
shared fixtures, capability identifiers, and explain rendering.

## DTCS and plan schema

DTCS should gain an optional portable definition block:

```yaml
specification:
  portableDefinition:
    protocol: etlantic.transform/1
    fingerprint: sha256:...
    expression: {}
```

Native implementations remain separate execution metadata. Loading a DTCS
artifact reconstructs data-only IR and never imports Python definition code.

The `PipelinePlan` schema needs:

- implementation kind
- portable protocol and fingerprint
- compiler identity and version
- requirements and support decisions
- deterministic/nondeterministic classification
- safe definition representation or content-addressed reference

Plan schema changes require compatibility fixtures and migration guidance.

## Diagnostics

Reserve `PMXFORMxxx`:

| Range | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PMXFORM1xx` | authoring and signature errors |
| `PMXFORM2xx` | name, type, contract, and output validation |
| `PMXFORM3xx` | plugin capability and compiler selection |
| `PMXFORM4xx` | compilation failures and semantic mismatches |
| `PMXFORM5xx` | runtime portable-transform failures |
| `PMXFORM8xx` | security and bounded-input rejection |
| `PMXFORM9xx` | internal invariants |

Every expression diagnostic includes transformation identity, output port,
expression path, stable requirement identifier, and remediation when possible.

## Testing strategy

### Unit and golden tests

- operators, nodes, types, canonicalization, and fingerprints
- serialized IR and plan schema
- explain and diagnostics output

### Conformance tests

Plugins run fixtures selected from advertised capabilities. Capability claims
must fail CI if the associated fixture is missing or failing.

### Differential tests

Generate bounded datasets containing nulls, NaN, extreme numbers, Unicode,
decimal edges, timezone transitions, duplicate keys, and empty inputs. Execute
the same IR across engines and compare normalized contract values.

### Property tests

Use property-based tests for type promotion, three-valued boolean logic,
canonicalization, deterministic fingerprints, and expression rewrites.

### Security tests

- hostile depth and node count
- oversized strings and literal collections
- executable-object rejection
- secret wrapper and secret-like value redaction
- unsafe SQL identifiers and injection payloads
- plugin allowlist and version mismatch
- no data access during planning

## Documentation gate

Before marking the feature available:

- convert accepted-design examples into runnable tests
- update capabilities and known limitations
- publish a complete supported-operation matrix per plugin
- document semantic differences that are rejected, not approximated
- add migration guidance for teams replacing native implementations
- generate API reference from the shipped public modules

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Familiar syntax implies full PySpark parity | publish explicit support matrix and excluded APIs |
| Backend semantic drift | normative semantics and differential conformance |
| IR grows into a general programming language | keep it closed, relational, and action-free |
| Plugin capability overclaim | capability-selected mandatory fixtures |
| Planning executes author code | static IR loading; symbolic decorator invocation only in trusted import path |
| Plans leak values | symbolic parameters, bounded literals, redaction, secret rejection |
| Optimization loses attribution | preserve logical expression and step mappings |
| Too much initial scope | kernel first; joins, windows, and complex types gated separately |

## Definition of done

The first public release is done only when:

1. The normative protocol and Python API agree.
2. Polars and PySpark independently pass kernel conformance.
3. Planning explains every compiler and fallback decision.
4. Unsupported semantics fail before execution.
5. Security and serialization gates pass.
6. Existing native implementations remain compatible.
7. Documentation examples execute in CI.
