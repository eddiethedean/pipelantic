# Evaluator Brief

A one-page answer for enterprise evaluators and technical decision-makers.

## What ETLantic is

A typed, contract-driven **modeling** layer for data pipelines in Python. You
define datasets, transformations, and pipelines once; ETLantic validates and
plans them; plugins execute.

It is **not** a dataframe engine, distributed scheduler, warehouse, or secret
manager.

## What is ready in alpha 0.11.0

| Area | Ready? |
|---|---|
| Typed authoring (`Data`, `Transformation`, `Pipeline`) | Yes |
| Validation and secret-free `PipelinePlan` | Yes |
| ODCS / DTCS / DPCS interchange | Yes |
| Local in-process runtime + run reports | Yes |
| Memory / callable / JSON / CSV / no-write storage | Yes |
| Env + mounted-file secrets | Yes |
| Polars / Pandas plugins | Yes (separate packages) |
| SQL plugin (`etlantic-sql`) | Yes (PostgreSQL reference) |
| PySpark plugin (`etlantic-pyspark`) | Yes (local provider; batch production path) |
| Structured Streaming | Experimental |
| Airflow / orchestrator compilation | Yes (`etlantic-airflow`) |
| DTCS 3.0 portable plan models/profiles | Yes (`dtcs>=0.13`) |
| `@Transformation.portable` authoring | Yes (0.11) |
| Portable compilers | No (0.12+) |
| Portable compiler execution | No (planned 0.12–0.15) |
| Multi-tenant durable orchestration | No |
| Formal SLA / support response times | No |

## Security posture

- Plans never contain resolved secrets
- SQL plugins use structured compilation with identifier/parameter safety;
  untrusted raw SQL is out of scope
- Spark session credentials resolve at acquire time and never embed in plans
- Plugin allowlists / version pins are **available** in 0.9+ via
  `Profile.plugin_allowlist` (production profiles fail closed when empty)
- Threat model documents residual Gaps (provenance, artifact/cache isolation,
  DoS budgets, outbound constraints, unsafe-serialization prohibition)
- Report vulnerabilities privately; alpha has best-effort fixes only

Read [Security](../02_FOUNDATIONS/SECURITY.md) and the repository
[security policy](https://github.com/eddiethedean/etlantic/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
For a bounded pilot topology and required controls, read
[Production Readiness](../06_EXECUTION/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md).

## Production readiness gate (do not skip)

**ETLantic 0.11 is alpha.** Plugin allowlists being “Available” does **not**
mean the product is production-ready.

Do **not** productionize until the security release gate closes (targeted for
1.0). Residual Gaps that still block a production claim include:

| Gap (from Security Evaluation) | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Plugin provenance beyond allowlist/pins | Supply-chain attestation incomplete |
| Artifact and cache isolation | Cross-run / cross-tenant exposure risk |
| Outbound destination constraints | SSRF / exfiltration controls incomplete |
| Denial-of-service budgets | Unbounded planning/load work |
| Unsafe serialization prohibition | Deserialization attack surface |
| In-process multi-tenancy | Explicitly out of scope—use process isolation |

Treat process-local run reports as operational evidence for a single process,
not an audit system of record.

[Documentation Status](../02_FOUNDATIONS/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md).

## What not to bet on yet

- Copying long Airflow **design study** tutorials into production—use
  `examples/airflow_compile.py` and `etlantic-airflow` instead
- Treating Structured Streaming APIs as stable (they are experimental)
- AWS Secrets Manager / Vault (not shipped); OS keyring **is** available via
  `etlantic-keyring`
- Process-local reports as an audit system of record
- Stable 1.0 compatibility guarantees
- Managed Databricks/EMR/Connect Spark providers
- Portable `@Transformation.portable` / `etlantic.transform` (the DTCS 3.0
  semantic foundation is published, but ETLantic authoring/compiler APIs are
  still the 0.11–0.15 design program)

## Recommended evaluation path

1. [Installation](INSTALLATION.md) — `pip install etlantic`
2. [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) or `examples/quickstart.py`
3. [Capabilities](CAPABILITIES.md)
4. Optional: `examples/dataframe_parity.py` with Polars or Pandas
5. Optional: `examples/sql_to_sql.py` (and other `examples/sql_*.py`) with
   `etlantic-sql`
6. Optional: `examples/pyspark_local.py` with `etlantic-pyspark`
7. Optional: `examples/airflow_compile.py` with `etlantic-airflow`
8. Optional: SparkForge adapter via `uv sync --group sparkforge`
9. [Migration 0.9 → 0.10](../11_DEVELOPMENT/MIGRATION_0_9_TO_0_10.md) if upgrading
10. [Roadmap](../11_DEVELOPMENT/ROADMAP.md) for sequencing
